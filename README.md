# Pre_Regression_Calculations
A program that quickly takes sales data and transform it into input needed for nine different regression analysis.


During my summer electives, I had one class in Supply Chain Analytics where we had to analyse sales data by either linear, exponential or quadratic regression, and either the normal way, with dummies, or with deseasonalized sales. Before any of this could happen, I had to transform my data in excel. This program intends to do that task for me and will take sales data and transform it into three sheets where one has multiple choices in regard to choice of regression analysis. I have attached two excel sheets with sales to use as an example.
